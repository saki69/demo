Bangladesh is a large deltaic plain formed under the influence of three mighty rivers –Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna with its flat topography, abundant water and sub tropical climate, constitutes an excellent habitat for the rice plant.

With time, as the population increased at a rapid pace, the gap between rice prod uction and food requirement for the millions widened. To feed the increasing population through  radical change in rice production, replacement of the low-yielding traditional varieties and age old produ ction practices of rice by high-yielding varieties and improved production technologies became essential.
Rice research in this part of the sub-continent started in 1910 that got momentum in mid 60s. 
	
Realizing the importance of rice in food security and political stability of the country,an autonomous organization in the n am e of East Pakistan Rice research Institute ( EPRRI) was established on 1 October 1970 on 76.82 hectare of land at Gazipur,36 km north of the capital city Dhaka, 
which was renamed as the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) after the independence in 1971.
